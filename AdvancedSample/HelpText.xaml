                    Left-drag a connector to create a connection.  To finalize creation of the connection 
                    continue to drag it until you can drop in on a different connector that is valid.  
                    Remember that inputs can only be connected to outputs, and vice-versa.  Inputs cannot
                    be connect inputs and outputs cannot be connected to outputs.

                    The 'connection ok' icon is displayed if you have dragged over a valid connector and the connection
                    will be created successfully.  The 'connection bad' icon is displayed if you have dragged over an
                    invalid connection, if you drop the end of the connection here the connection will be deleted.
