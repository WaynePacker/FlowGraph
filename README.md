# FlowGraph

I am playing around with a node editor.
The idea is to replicate something like the [Unreal Engine 4 Blueprint system](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Blueprints/).

This code was originally from a [tutorial on CodeProject](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/182683/NetworkView-A-WPF-custom-control-for-visualizing-a)

## Running the application

To start, set Flow.UI as the startup project in Visual Studio and that's it.
